            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
                    Grease an 8x11-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Cook and stir breakfast sausage in a skillet over 
                    medium heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes; 
                    drain excess grease.
                </li>
                <li>Mix green onion into the sausage and spread into the bottom 
                    of the prepared baking dish. Spread hash brown potatoes in 
                    a layer over top; sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.</li>
                <li>Whisk eggs, milk, and gravy mix together in a bowl until smooth;
                    pour over casserole. Season with paprika.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the 
                    center of the casserole comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let stand
                    10 minutes to firm up before serving.</li>
