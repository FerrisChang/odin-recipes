            <h2>Description</h2>
            Sometimes you want all the goodness of a full breakfast 
            but need to take it on the go—so these 'cookies' were created 
            to fill that need! Layers of egg, cheese, and sausage give 
            these biscuit-like cookies lots of satisfying flavor! Serve 
            with sour cream and taco sauce.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 ounces breakfast sausage</li>
                <li>½ finely minced white onion</li>
                <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>3 medium eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
                <li>1 pinch freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F 
                    (190 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper</li>
                <li>Heat a non stick skillet over medium 
                    heat and cook sausage until crumbly, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                    Add in the onion and cook, stirring and breaking up the 
                    sausage until it is no longer pink. Transfer mixture to a paper 
                    towel-lined plate and drain for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, 
                    Parmesan cheese, and parsley in a large bowl; whisking until
                     well combined. Whisk in eggs until well combined. Add 3/4 cup 
                     Cheddar cheese and stir until mixed in. Spoon in sausage mixture 
                     and mix to form a thick batter.</li>
                <li>Scoop out about a 1/4 cup of the mixture and drop onto 
                    the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle each 'cookie' with 
                    Cheddar cheese and slightly flatten with your fingers.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 10 minutes. 
                    If cookie is still a little soft, cook for 2 minutes longer. 
                    Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.</li>
            </ol>
